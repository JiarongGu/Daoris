# Fix log

Root cause, fix, and verification for non-trivial defects — the record version control cannot carry:
a diff shows what changed and never why the old behaviour was wrong. Newest first. The knowledge
service indexes this file per entry, so a sibling can ask "has anyone hit this" without opening the
repository.

## "Single file" leaves the SQLite native library behind (2026-09-19)

**Symptom.** The installed `daoris-knowledge.exe` died on first store open with `DllNotFoundException`
for `e_sqlite3` — after the same binary had appeared to work when probed from inside the workspace.

**Root cause.** `PublishSingleFile` bundles managed assemblies but places **native** libraries beside
the executable by default; the install step copied only the exe. The in-workspace probe masked it
twice over: a stdio host under a null stdin exits immediately and *cleanly* before touching the store,
which a naive probe reads as a crash — or as success.

**Fix.** `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true` in `tools/service-publish.mjs`, making the file
genuinely single.

**Verification.** The installed binaries, run from a neutral working directory: the MCP host starts,
warns exactly when no root is named and only then, and exits cleanly on stdin close; the HTTP host
serves both the API and the page. Asserted on behaviour, not on the process staying alive.

## A repository that left the disk never left the index (2026-09-19)

**Symptom.** The platform's Overview served a repository renamed weeks earlier — dozens of entries,
indistinguishable from a live project — on the one surface whose job is telling a person what exists.

**Root cause.** `KnowledgeIndex.RefreshAsync` replaced entries per repository it FOUND and said
nothing about repositories it did not. Replace-what-you-saw is silent about the absent, and the
absent is exactly where ghosts live.

**Fix.** After replacing, any repository held by the store but missing from the scan is replaced with
an empty set — guarded on the scan having found at least one repository, because a scan that saw
nothing is a mis-set root far more often than a family that emptied, and "refresh wiped the index" is
the wrong answer to a wrong path.

**Verification.** Test red first (`RefreshTests.A_repository_that_left_the_source_leaves_the_index`),
then green, plus the saw-nothing guard case. Then proven on the real store: one refresh retired both
ghosts (16 → 14 repositories) and `/api/repositories` lists only what is on disk.

## The HTTP host's documented defaults were both untrue (2026-09-19)

**Symptom.** Launched exactly as the README says — `dotnet run --project …Http` — the host bound
port 5000 rather than the documented 5177, and its default family root resolved to the service's own
tree, whose subprojects would have been indexed as though they were the family.

**Root cause.** Two unbacked claims, the `claims-need-checks` shape. Nothing set the port, so
Kestrel's default won. And the root's "parent of the current directory" heuristic assumed the CWD was
the workspace — `dotnet run` sets the CWD to the project directory. Every earlier run had supplied
both by environment, so the defaults themselves had never once been exercised.

**Fix.** The host defaults its own URL to 5177 (an explicit `ASPNETCORE_URLS` still wins), and the
family root walks up from the binary to this workspace's manifest exactly as the MCP host already
did, with the old heuristic as the last resort.

**Verification.** Launched with no environment at all: right port, right family. The family rehearsal
re-ran after the change, 22/22. No store pollution had occurred — no request ever reached the
mis-rooted instance.
