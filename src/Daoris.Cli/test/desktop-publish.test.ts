/**
 * The publish guard (`tools/desktop-publish.mjs`): what it refuses to write into, and the one door
 * through it. Tested here because the decision is a pure function of a folder's contents, and the
 * deployment rehearsal proves only the default refusal — every other branch costs a full build there.
 *
 * The guard's own reason stands: a publish into somebody's documents folder and a publish into an
 * install folder look identical to `cpSync`. What the second deployment added is a third folder — the
 * one the person actually wants, holding the repositories the application drives — and `--beside`
 * names that intent. It is not a weaker default: it still refuses to write over a name it did not
 * write, because those are the only names it touches.
