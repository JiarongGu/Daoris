# Daoris.Service — the cross-repository knowledge service

**Status: not started.** This document is the brief.

## What it is for

A session in any repository can read that repository's doctrine, because `sync` put it on disk. It
cannot read what the *other* repositories learned. Every decision record, fix log and task outcome in
the family is invisible from anywhere but the repository that holds it — which is how the same problem
gets solved twice by the same person in two directories.

The service is the query layer over all of it: doctrine, decisions, and past task outcomes, across every
adopting repository.

## Why it comes after the canon, not before

Indexing content that is still divergent indexes the divergence. Six copies of a rule that disagree
produce six answers with no way to tell which is current — so the canon has to exist first, which it now
does. This is also why a generated wiki is a complement rather than a competitor (D16): a wiki is
derived from code and fails by going stale; doctrine is authored because something went wrong and fails
by diverging. The service indexes the second kind.

## Shape

- **ASP.NET Core**, so it can compose the family's existing LLM work rather than rebuild it — semantic
  memory, the embedder seam, the vector store and MCP hosting all already ship in the cognition sibling.
  That dependency becomes correct here precisely because this is a separate deployable; the CLI keeps
  its zero dependencies and never learns about this.
- **The canon is an input, not a copy.** `canon/` at the workspace root is the same tree the CLI
  materializes; the service reads it rather than holding its own.
- **Two clients, one UI** — see `Daoris.Web` and `Daoris.Desktop`.

## The design is written

**`docs/2026-08-05-daoris-service-design.md`** — read it before writing code. It settles:

- **Local-first, sharing as configuration** (D21). One service, two modes, one binary; local needs no
  server, no account and no network, and must stay fully useful alone.
- **The disclosure boundary** — what may leave a machine at all, which is the question this project has
  to answer before "who may read it". Indexing is opt-in per repository, silence means keep it local,
  and the untracked local directory is a hard exclusion rather than a permission.
- **Authorization mirrors repository access** rather than inventing a second model that would eventually
  disagree with the first, silently.
- **A git repository as the shared store**, before a database: free, versioned, reviewable, and its
  access control already *is* the rule above rather than a copy of it.
- **LLM-assisted merge proposes; a person disposes.** Doctrine that appeared without anyone choosing it
  is the failure this whole project exists to prevent.
- **Built by composition** (D22) — the cognition sibling supplies embeddings, the vector store, routing
  and MCP hosting; the desktop sibling supplies the shell. Released versions only, never working trees.

The sharpest open question is still the first one: **does shared mode need hosting at all?** If the store
is a git repository and the client is local, "shared" may be a sync rather than a server.
