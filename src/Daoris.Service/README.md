# Daoris.Service — the cross-repository knowledge service

**Status: usable from a session.** An MCP server over stdio exposes the index to any agent client. `Daoris.Service.Core` reads a repository's knowledge into
addressable entries, classifies each as canonical or local, stores them in SQLite, and answers ranked
queries over FTS5. 37 tests, two of which run against the real sibling repositories rather than
fixtures.

Indexing the whole family takes **~500 ms for 408 entries** into a 7 MB database; queries answer in
**3–10 ms**.

## Running it

```sh
cd src/Daoris.Service && dotnet build
# then point an MCP client at:
#   src/Daoris.Service/Daoris.Service.Mcp/bin/Debug/net10.0/daoris-knowledge.exe
```

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| `knowledge_search` | What has this family already learned about X? |
| `knowledge_get` | The full text of one entry |
| `knowledge_repositories` | What is searchable, and how much each repository contributes |
| `knowledge_refresh` | Re-read every repository from disk |

`ConvergenceDetector` answers a different question: **which repositories learned the same thing
independently?** It automates the survey that produced this project's own canon — reading twelve
repositories by hand to notice which documents said the same thing in different words. It proposes
candidates; a person decides, through `upstream`, under review.

Configuration is two optional variables, and **there is no URL and no key** — that is shared mode, and
it does not exist yet:

| | |
|---|---|
| `DAORIS_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT` | Where the repositories are. Default: the folder containing this workspace |
| `DAORIS_KNOWLEDGE_DB` | Where the index lives. Default: `~/.daoris/knowledge.db` |
| `DAORIS_EMBED_MODEL` | Names an embedding model to **enable semantic search**. Unset = lexical only |
| `DAORIS_EMBED_URL` | Embedding endpoint. Default: `http://localhost:11434` (Ollama) |

Semantic recall is opt-in and never required. Naming a model turns it on and hybrid fuses it with the
lexical index; leaving it unset keeps the service lexical-only rather than half-configured, because an
index that will not start without an embedding endpoint is not local-first. If the endpoint is
unreachable or misconfigured, the refresh still completes and reports the reason — verified against a
local server started without `--embeddings`, which is what the failure actually looks like.

```sh
cd src/Daoris.Service && dotnet test
```

## What it finds today

Scanned across the family, 2026-08-05:

| Kind | Local | Canonical |
|---|---:|---:|
| Rule | 101 | 15 |
| Skill | 96 | 5 |
| Knowledge | 62 | 2 |
| Decision | 58 | 0 |
| Task outcome | 53 | 0 |
| Fix | 13 | 0 |
| **Total** | **383** | **22** |

**405 entries across 11 repositories, and 94% of them are local** — which is the premise of the whole
index, measured rather than assumed. Canonical content is identical in every repository that installs
it, so indexing it per repository would produce a dozen copies of one rule and call that a corpus. The
local material is what varies, and 124 of those entries are decisions, fixes and task outcomes that no
sibling repository can currently reach at all.

## The seams

Four extension points, each with one job, so the pieces that are still undecided can be swapped
without touching the ones that are not.

| Seam | Today | Later |
|---|---|---|
| `IKnowledgeSource` | The local filesystem | A git remote, or a devkit gate that pushes |
| `IKnowledgeStore` | SQLite file, or in memory for tests | A hosted store only if volume ever demands one |
| `IKnowledgeSearch` | FTS5 + BM25, semantic, and hybrid fusing both | An embedder that is not a test double |
| `IDisclosurePolicy` | `LocalOnly` — nothing leaves | `Sharing(repositories)` — opt-in per repository |

Two choices worth knowing about:

- **Search returns scored hits, not a list.** Scores are what let two searches be merged, so hybrid
  is a composition rather than a third implementation.
- **Hybrid fuses on rank, not on score.** BM25 returns an unbounded figure and cosine similarity a
  number in [-1, 1]; adding them compares quantities that mean different things, and whichever has the
  larger range silently wins. Reciprocal rank fusion uses only each result's position in its own list.
- **Semantic search is optional and degrades.** The embedder is app-provided, so with none configured
  the service is lexical-only and local mode still works with nothing installed. If either half fails
  the other still answers — an index that returns nothing because an endpoint is down is worse than one
  that returns half of what it knows.
- **The disclosure policy is applied at ingest, not at query.** Withheld-at-query means the material
  is in the store and one forgotten filter discloses it; withheld-at-ingest means it was never there
  to leak. It is a *type* rather than a paragraph so that shared mode cannot be built without
  answering it.

## What it is for

A session in any repository can read that repository's doctrine, because `sync` put it on disk. It
cannot read what the *other* repositories learned. Every decision record, fix log and task outcome in
the family is invisible from anywhere but the repository that holds it — which is how the same problem
gets solved twice by the same person in two directories.

The service is the query layer over all of it: doctrine, decisions, and past task outcomes, across every
adopting repository.

## Why it comes after the canon, not before

Indexing content that is still divergent indexes the divergence. Six copies of a rule that disagree
produce six answers with no way to tell which is current — so the canon has to exist first, which it now
does. This is also why a generated wiki is a complement rather than a competitor (D16): a wiki is
derived from code and fails by going stale; doctrine is authored because something went wrong and fails
by diverging. The service indexes the second kind.

## Shape

- **ASP.NET Core**, so it can compose the family's existing LLM work rather than rebuild it — semantic
  memory, the embedder seam, the vector store and MCP hosting all already ship in the cognition sibling.
  That dependency becomes correct here precisely because this is a separate deployable; the CLI keeps
  its zero dependencies and never learns about this.
- **The canon is an input, not a copy.** `canon/` at the workspace root is the same tree the CLI
  materializes; the service reads it rather than holding its own.
- **Two clients, one UI** — see `Daoris.Web` and `Daoris.Desktop`.

## The design is written

**`docs/2026-08-05-daoris-service-design.md`** — read it before writing code. It settles:

- **Local-first, sharing as configuration** (D21). One service, two modes, one binary; local needs no
  server, no account and no network, and must stay fully useful alone.
- **The disclosure boundary** — what may leave a machine at all, which is the question this project has
  to answer before "who may read it". Indexing is opt-in per repository, silence means keep it local,
  and the untracked local directory is a hard exclusion rather than a permission.
- **Authorization mirrors repository access** rather than inventing a second model that would eventually
  disagree with the first, silently.
- **A git repository as the shared store**, before a database: free, versioned, reviewable, and its
  access control already *is* the rule above rather than a copy of it.
- **LLM-assisted merge proposes; a person disposes.** Doctrine that appeared without anyone choosing it
  is the failure this whole project exists to prevent.
- **Built by composition** (D22) — the cognition sibling supplies embeddings, the vector store, routing
  and MCP hosting; the desktop sibling supplies the shell. Released versions only, never working trees.

The sharpest open question is still the first one: **does shared mode need hosting at all?** If the store
is a git repository and the client is local, "shared" may be a sync rather than a server.
