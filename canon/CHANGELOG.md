# Canon changelog

**Why each version of the doctrine changed.** `daoris status` prints the entries between a repository's
locked version and the version shipping in the package, so a consumer sees not only *which* documents
moved but whether the change matters to them.

Write one entry per version, newest first, under a `## <version>` heading. Say what changed and what an
adopting repository should do about it — a line that only repeats the filename adds nothing that the
`changed` list did not already say. This file ships inside the package, so nothing here touches the
network.

## Unreleased

- The first canon: seven workflow rules, and five skills — `doc-loader` and `pattern-finder` to start a
  task, `post-feature` and `fix-log` to close one, `caveman` for terse output. Nothing to upgrade from
  yet.
