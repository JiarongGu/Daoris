# <Repository> — the documents

<Every document a session may need, what kind it is, and whether it still stands. Read at a task's
start. A document not listed here is one no session will find. When a document and a later decision
disagree, the decision wins, and the row says so.>

**Kinds.** A *contract* is what a part is and must keep being; it is built against. A *method* is how
something gets built. A *study* is input to a decision, read for its reasoning. *Evidence* is what was
measured, and it stays a record of that moment. A *record* is append-only and read by lookup.

| Document | Kind | For | Where it stands |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | contract | <what it decides, in one line> | current |
| `<path>` | method | <how what is done> | amended by <decision> |
| `<path>` | study | <what it compared> | superseded by `<path>` |
| `<path>` | evidence | <what it measured, and when> | a record of that moment |
