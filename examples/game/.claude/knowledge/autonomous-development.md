# Autonomous development — the person at the ends, gates in the middle

**Development here is automation-first. A person states the target and verifies the result; the
steps between are executed by agents and verified by gates, not by per-step approval.**

## Why

Step-by-step interaction does not scale past a small system. A large application is built as many
subsystems and many verification runs, and a person approving every reversible step becomes the
bottleneck on exactly the work that needed no judgement — while their attention is spent long before
the one step that did.

Approval fatigue is the quieter half, and the dangerous one. A reviewer asked to confirm forty
mechanical steps stops reading them, and the step that deserved a real decision then arrives to a
reader trained to click through. Concentrating human attention at two points — the target at the
start, the diff and the gate results at the end — is what keeps that attention worth something.

The middle is not less verified for having no person in it; it is verified *better*. A gate runs
every time, identically, and exits non-zero; a person verifies occasionally, differently each time,
and tires. What a person uniquely supplies is judgement about outcomes — so the process should hand
them an outcome to judge: a reviewable diff, a green gate run, and a record of what was decided and
why.

## How to apply

- **Take the target, then run.** A reversible step that serves the stated target is executed and
  recorded, not proposed and awaited. Questions that arise mid-run are batched to the next
  checkpoint unless the work is genuinely blocked on the answer.
- **Done means gates green plus a reviewable record.** The tests, the drift and budget checks, the
  repository's own verification — and the diff, with the task and decision records updated. That
  bundle is what the person verifies, in one sitting, at the end.
- **The carve-outs sit at the outward boundary.** A commit is part of the run: it is local,
  reversible, and lands per task once gates are green, so the landed history *is* the reviewable
  record. What remains explicitly human is everything that cannot be taken back or that leaves the
  repository — a push to a shared remote, a publish or release, a history rewrite, a write into a
  sibling, and any destructive action. Autonomy earns trust by never spending it there.
- **Record as you go, because nobody is watching the middle.** The decision log, the backlog and
  the fix log are what make an unattended run reviewable afterwards — a step that exists only in a
  session transcript did not happen, as far as the final verification can tell.
- **Work for another repository is published, never performed.** An agent that reaches a
  neighbour's boundary files the request through the proper channel and continues with its own
  work. Autonomy is scoped to the repository it runs in.
- **Look before you ask.** A question the task's own material, the repository's documents, code and history, or
  a neighbouring repository's documents you may read can settle is not a question for the person: settle it,
  and keep the evidence for the hand-over. Where the evidence leans one way without settling it, take that
  reading and state it at the checkpoint, where it is reviewed with the rest of the outcome. Only what no source
  holds and only the person can give reaches them mid-run: a sign-in, a go-ahead for an act outside the
  repository or on a live system, a preference nothing records.
- **A step that genuinely needs a human choice surfaces as a decision, not a pause.** State the
  options, the recommendation and the reason at the checkpoint. A question arriving with its
  analysis is decided in seconds; a bare "may I?" in the middle of a run is a stall that teaches
  the person to stop reading.
