# Daoris (道衍) — Active Task Backlog

> **This file holds OPEN tasks only.** A finished task is **removed from here and appended to
> [`docs/task-archive.md`](docs/task-archive.md)** with its date and outcome — never ticked in place.
> `CHANGELOG.md` is the release-facing log; the archive is the per-task record. The contract is
> `docs/2026-08-04-daoris-design.md`; the forward sequence is [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

**Goal:** one canonical set of agent-facing rules and knowledge, materialized into every repository in
the family, kept from drifting, and improved from wherever the improvement was found — and, as of D45,
**Daoris as the driver**: the centralized workflow manager that triggers and coordinates the agent
sessions doing the family's work. Parts 1 and 2 of D45 are **built and proven by a real driven run**
(D46, `docs/2026-09-19-driver-design.md`; DRV4 in the archive). The owner continued the sequence
2026-09-20: part 3 is now **designed (DRV3 → D47, `docs/2026-09-20-remote-design.md`) and built
(DRV5, six landings, in the archive)** — the remote server exists, gate-proven by the family
rehearsal's two-machine phase. **All three parts of D45 are built.**

## State

**All five artefacts exist and are built, and all three parts of D45 with them.** Nine commands,
128 CLI tests, 158 service, 57 devkit, 49 driver, 52/52 release rehearsal (eight runs 2026-09-18),
**74/74 family rehearsal** including the driver and two-machine remote phases (2026-09-20), 9 devkit
gates. Canon: 8 core rules, 5 knowledge documents, 5 skills, 6 packs. Always-loaded core is
**23,988 of 24,000 bytes** — 12 bytes of headroom, so the next canon addition fails the gate even as
an index row, and the answer is splitting, not raising (D28).

**The remote exists** (D47/DRV5, built 2026-09-20): the same HTTP host in shared mode gates every
route with per-person per-machine minted keys (`keys mint|list|revoke`, hashed with an audit prefix,
expiring), refuses to bind beyond loopback in local mode, and never serves a machine path or a page;
the quest lock is code (an atomic guarded `Taken` transition, closed quests immovable) in the shared
judgement class, so local mode is hardened too; a quest homes at the remote when its receiver is
joined and verbs write through synchronously or fail plainly; the desktop's sync loop rides the driver
tick — feeding stripped registrations, session records keyed by origin + id, and opted-in knowledge
content (never vectors) up, mirroring the family's quests and foreign registrations down. What may
leave a machine is two manifest declarations (join; share knowledge), silence meaning local. Proven
by the rehearsal's remote phase: a quest crossed two machines and drove to done, a raced take left the
losing driver observing the lock, and the remote store was scanned to hold nothing machine-local.

**The driver drives** (D45/D46, built 2026-09-19): `Daoris.Desktop.Driver` (pure planner, observed
lifecycle, adapter seam — stub + `claude-code`), the headless `daoris-driver`, and the shell
`daoris-desktop` on released Shenora.Windows 0.16.0 — it brings up the local HTTP host, carries the
platform, runs the loop in-process, and lands the person's controls (drivable/hold per repository,
stop a running session) through the `DAORIS.DRIVER` IPC module, live-updating over `DRIVER_TICK`.
The quest state machine is the only lock; outside sessions stay first-class. **The loop is proven
with a real session** (DRV4, 2026-09-19): a scratch-born project, a real quest, a real `claude-code`
session spawned by the driver — it claimed its quest over its own connector under headless
`acceptEdits`, committed the work, closed the quest `done` with its note, and the driver's record
carries the commit as evidence, 71 seconds end to end.

The service is **deployable** (D36) and **ships as executables** (D43): `npm run publish:service --
--install` lands both hosts self-contained in `~/.daoris/bin` and prints the ready `.mcp.json`
snippet; the release workflow ships them per platform with sha256s beside the devkit. Local sessions
spawn the MCP host over one persistent store; the HTTP host carries registrations and quests for a
remote deployment, key-gated, **no model required**. **The loops create their consumer** (D44): the
family rehearsal (43 checks) and the Playwright suite (7 tests) each run over a scratch copy of the
examples and take a project born mid-run through init → declare → sync → check → connect → its first
quest. `Daoris.Web` is **the platform** (D38,
D40, D41, D42): five views landing on **Overview** — is anything sitting, the family's health, quests
grouped by state with sitting time, projects as scannable declarations — in a designed console shell
(sidebar, drawers, toasts, a validated status palette; `docs/2026-09-19-platform-ux.md`), built on
headless libraries (Tailwind v4 on the tokens, Radix, TanStack Query; `docs/2026-09-19-frontend-architecture.md`),
speaking **en + 简体中文** with a parity gate, with Storybook as the design tool and a test pyramid
declared in `daoris.gates.json` — a **21-test Vitest inner loop** and a **7/7 Playwright outer loop
over `examples/`**. Doctrine stays unwritable from every view. The **example family** under `examples/` is the router's proof and the setup story (D39) — a
canon change must re-sync it in the same commit, and `npm run rehearse:family` enforces that.
Development is **automation-first** (D37): the person sets the target and verifies the final diff;
agents execute and gates verify the middle. `docs/FIX-LOG.md` carries fix root causes, indexed by the
service like every sibling's.

Nothing is published; development runs at `0.0.x`. **Adoption by other repositories is the owner's call
and happens when Daoris is ready** — it is not tracked here, and no repository is asked to adopt until
Daoris is finished. Lyntai stepped off the tool 2026-08-17 (owner-requested; the synced files remain
there as local forks), so the live consumer count is zero and Lyntai is not quest-addressable until it
re-adopts. The Shenora rehearsal keeps and does not expire: 6 collisions, 2 twins to retire, local
mechanics drafted at `docs/adoption/shenora-repo-mechanics.md`, budget 40,000, `check` clean at
38,782 bytes, with `web-webview` and `durable-jobs` ready for it.

## Handover — where a fresh session picks up

**The D45 arc is complete: all three parts built, gated, and app-verified (2026-09-20).** There is no
forced next build task — the connector, the local driver, and the remote all exist and are proven. A
fresh session's realistic starting points, none of them automatic:

- **Read first:** `docs/DECISIONS.md` D45 (the direction) and **D47** (the remote, with its two
  build-time amendments); `docs/2026-09-20-remote-design.md` (the remote contract); the DRV5 entry in
  `docs/task-archive.md` (what the six landings did); `docs/FIX-LOG.md` top two entries (the
  stale-`dist/` and driver-mode-default traps — both bite silently).
- **A release is the obvious next move, and REH1 blocks it.** Everything is `## Unreleased` in the
  changelog and development runs at `0.0.x`; the changelog now covers the driver and the remote. But
  **do not tag while REH1 is open** (below) — a release runs the release rehearsal, which is the thing
  that intermittently fails. Clearing REH1 is the real gate on a first release.
- **Nothing is pushed or published** — that stays the owner's call, as does adoption by any repository.
  The live consumer count is zero (Lyntai stepped off); no repository is asked to adopt until the owner
  says so.
- **The held backlog items each wait on an external trigger** (a captured rehearsal failure, a second
  repository, a real request) — pick one up only when its trigger has actually arrived, not to have
  something to do.
- **Verify before claiming done, always:** `npm run verify` (CLI 128 + `check`), `dotnet test
  src/Daoris.Service` (158), `dotnet test src/Daoris.Desktop/Daoris.Desktop.Driver.Tests` (49),
  `npm run rehearse:family` (74/74), `npm run test:web` (21 + 7). If a `bin`-driven gate is red while
  `npm test` is green, suspect a stale gitignored `dist/` first (FIX-LOG).

## Backlog

- [ ] **REH1 — the release rehearsal intermittently reports 45/52.** Seen twice, **always exactly 7
  failures** — precisely the canon-upgrade phase's 7 checks, so a whole phase fails on a broken
  precondition rather than a flaky assertion. Both times it ran straight after canon files were edited
  and synced. **Every run now writes a transcript to `_fixtures/rehearsal-logs/` by construction**
  (2026-09-18), so the next failure is captured without anyone remembering to. Eight runs that day —
  several straight after canon edits and syncs, the suspected trigger — all passed 52/52. Stays
  open until a captured failure explains it. Do not tag a release while this is open.

- [ ] **CANON5 — i18n en/zh parity as canon: the two-repository bar is met.** The bilingual sibling
  carries the rule and the gate; Daoris now carries the same gate (`scripts/i18n-check.mjs`, adopted
  from it deliberately — D42). Two repositories, one lesson: a missing translation "works" in English
  and is discovered by the first reader it fails. Held rather than written because the always-loaded
  core is 12 bytes from its budget — even an index row fails the gate — so canonizing waits on the
  D28-shaped split of principle from detail, or lands as pack knowledge for web repositories.

- [ ] **CANON2 — `desktop-winforms`, the last pack candidate.** One 11 KB source, one repository —
  below the two-repository bar, which is the whole reason the canon is trustworthy. Leave it local until
  a second repository needs the same thing.

- [ ] **HARNESS1 — a second harness layout.** `src/harness.ts` holds the signals and contract checks; a
  second implementation slots in beside the Claude one. Do not start until a repository actually wants
  it — the layout, always-loaded semantics and trigger mechanism all differ, and guessing produces
  doctrine nobody chose in a format nobody verified.

## How to work a task

- **TDD:** failing test → run it fail → minimal implementation → run it pass → commit.
- **Commit per task, automatically, once gates are green** (D37 as amended). Push, publish, release
  and history rewrites stay the owner's call.
- **`npm run verify` before claiming done.**
- **A canon file is project-agnostic** — the principle and the reason, never the mechanism. See
  `.claude/knowledge/canon-authoring.md`.
- **When a task completes, move it to `docs/task-archive.md`** with the date and outcome.
